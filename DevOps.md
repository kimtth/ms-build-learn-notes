## What is DevOps?

The contraction of "Dev" and "Ops" refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations. The idea is to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications. DevOps is a constant journey.

<img src="notes/devops-cycle-98924900.png" alt="package" width="450"/>

- Greenfield projects:
A greenfield project will always appear to be a more accessible starting point. A blank slate offers the chance to implement everything the way that you want.

- Brownfield projects:
Usually, brownfield projects come with:

    1. The baggage of existing codebases.
    1. Existing teams.
    1. A significant amount of technical debt.

- Systems of record:
Systems that provide the truth about data elements are often-called systems of record. These systems have historically evolved slowly and carefully. 

- Systems of engagement:
Many organizations have other systems that are more exploratory. These often use experimentation to solve new problems. Systems of engagement are modified regularly.

- In discussions around continuous delivery, we usually categorize users into three general buckets:

    1. Canary users voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they're available.
    1. Early adopters who voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the code that exposes canary users.
    1. Users who consume the products after passing through canary and early adopters.

- Waterfall
Traditional software development practices involve:

    1. Determining a problem.
    1. Analyzing the requirements.
    1. Building and testing the required code.
    1. The delivery outcome to users.

- Agile

    - Agile software development methods are based on releases and iterations:

    1. One release might consist of several iterations.
    1. Each iteration is like a small independent project.
    1. After being estimated and prioritization:
        1. Features, bug fixes, enhancements, and refactoring width are assigned to a release.
        1. And then assigned again to a specific iteration within the release, generally on a priority basis.
    1. At the end of each iteration, there should be tested working code.
    1. In each iteration, the team must focus on the outcomes of the previous iteration and learn from them.

    - 12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto | Agile Alliance.

        - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
        - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
        - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of months to a couple of weeks, with a preference for a shorter timescale.
        - Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
        - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
        - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
        - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
        - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
        - Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
        - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
        - The team regularly reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Identify project metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs)

-  Faster outcomes
    1. Deployment Frequency. Increasing the frequency of deployments is often a critical driver in DevOps Projects.
    1. Deployment Speed. It is necessary to reduce the time that they take.
    1. Deployment Size. How many features, stories, and bug fixes are being deployed each time?
    1. Lead Time. How long does it take from the creation of a work item until it is completed?

-  Efficiency
    1. Server to Admin Ratio. Are the projects reducing the number of administrators required for a given number of servers?
    1. Staff Member to Customers Ratio. Is it possible for fewer staff members to serve a given number of customers?
    1. Application Usage. How busy is the application?
    1. Application Performance. Is the application performance improving or dropping? (Based upon application metrics)?

-  Quality and security
    1. Deployment failure rates. How often do deployments (or applications) fail?
    1. Application failure rates. How often do application failures occur, such as configuration failures, performance timeouts, and so on?
    1. Mean time to recover. How quickly can you recover from a failure?
    1. Bug report rates. You do not want customers finding bugs in your code. Is the amount they are seeing increasing or lowering?
    1. Test pass rates. How well is your automated testing working?
    1. Defect escape rate. What percentage of defects are being found in production?
    1. Availability. What percentage of time is the application truly available for customers?
    1. Service level agreement achievement. Are you meeting your service level agreements (SLAs)?
    1. Mean time to detection. If there is a failure, how long does it take for it to be detected?

-  Culture
    1. Employee morale. Are employees happy with the transformation and where the organization is heading? Are they still willing to respond to further changes? This metric can be challenging to measure but is often done by periodic, anonymous employee surveys.
    1. Retention rates. Is the organization losing staff?

## Choose the DevOps tools

1. Jira is a commonly used work management tool.

## Introduction to source control

- The State of DevOps Report 2021 highlights version control in almost all stages of DevOps evolution.

    <img src="notes/foundational-practices-five-stages-zero-two-5bd71abb.png" alt="package" width="650"/>

    <img src="notes/foundational-practices-five-stages-tree-five-00bc5230.png" alt="package" width="650"/>

- A Source control system (or version control system) allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes. Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. Source control is an essential tool for multi-developer projects.

- The version control system saves a snapshot of your files (history) so that you can review and even roll back to any version of your code with ease. Also, it helps to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.

- "Code does not exist unless it is committed into source control. Source control is the fundamental enabler of continuous delivery."

    <img src="notes/pipeline-phases-808e4101.png" alt="package" width="650"/>

- Explore best practices for source control

    1. Make small changes. In other words, commit early and commit often. Be careful not to commit any unfinished work that could break the build.
    1. Do not commit personal files. It could include application settings or SSH keys. Often personal files are committed accidentally but cause problems later when other team members work on the same code.
    1. Update often and right before pushing to avoid merge conflicts.
    1. Verify your code change before pushing it to a repository; ensure it compiles and tests are passing.
    1. Pay close attention to commit messages, as it will tell you why a change was made. Consider committing messages as a mini form of documentation for the change.
    1. Link code changes to work items. It will concretely link what was created to why it was created—or modified by providing traceability across requirements and code changes.
