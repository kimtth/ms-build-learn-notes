- Viva Insights provides data-driven insights and targeted recommendations to foster productivity and wellbeing. With Viva Insights, your organization can gather and access information like:

    1. Personal Insights that are visible only to each employee. Personal Insights includes things like briefing emails in Outlook or information on their personal Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web. This way, people across the organization can learn more about how they work personally, and get recommendations to protect their time, focus, and productivity.
    1. Teamwork habits that provide a better understanding of how you work in teams, including your team meeting habits, impact on others' quiet hours, and whether you're getting enough one-on-one time with teammates.
    1. Organizational trends enable leadership and senior managers to see how their working culture might be affecting the overall well-being and work productivity of their people.

- Viva Goals creates a clear structure to align people's work to the team's or organization's goals. You can set, track, and manage goals for your organization, and align your teams and individuals to those goals at a scale. To enable this, Viva Goals introduces the concept of **objectives and key results (OKR) framework**.

- Both Viva Learning and Viva Topics support learning and growth for employees in your organization. Viva Learning aggregates and curates learning content, such as courses, videos, eBooks, and audio from various sources and platforms.

- Viva Learning serves as your gateway to aggregate formal learning content from multiple sources, Viva Topics curates information using AI on topics in your organization and provides it when you need it. The topics can be about the following types:

    - Project
    - Event
    - Organization
    - Location
    - Product
    - Creative work
    - Field of study

    As you read content stored in Microsoft 365, topics will be highlighted inline. When you hover over the topic name, you’ll see more information shown in a topic card.

    For instance, when new employees join the organization, it’s challenging to understand various terms and acronyms used by the organization. New employees often have trouble finding project files and people to contact for questions and information. Viva Topics can automatically collect and provide access to information in this way so that employees can engage with their work earlier and more efficiently.

    You can access the Microsoft Viva Topic Center by opening the Viva Topics app directly from Teams. However, AI curated Topics are displayed to you in many places, including:

    - Topics highlighted on SharePoint pages
    - Topic answers in search results
    - Search in office applications
    - Topic center
