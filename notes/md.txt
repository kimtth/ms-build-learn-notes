|Creation                      |Created as part of an Azure resource, such as an Azure virtual machine or Azure App Service.                                                                                   |Created as a standalone Azure resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|Lifecycle                     |Shared lifecycle with the Azure resource. When the parent resource is deleted, the managed identity is also deleted.                                                           |Independent life cycle. Must be explicitly deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|Sharing across Azure resources|Cannot be shared. Associated with a single Azure resource.                                                                                                                     |Can be shared. A user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|Common use cases              |Workloads that are contained within a single Azure resource. Workloads for which you need independent identities, such as an application that runs on a single virtual machine.|Workloads that run on multiple resources and which can share a single identity. Workloads that need preauthorization to a secure resource as part of a provisioning flow. Workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent. For example, a workload where multiple virtual machines need to access the same resource.|
