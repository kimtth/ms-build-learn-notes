|System Customizer   |Create (self), Read (self), Write (self), Delete (self), Customizations|This role has full permission to customize the environment. But users who have this role can view rows only for environment tables that they create.

|Start      |For organizations that are at the beginning of their cloud adoption journey (called greenfield) and want to implement a new cloud environment, based on best practices and proven architectural patterns.Start with the conceptual architecture of Azure landing zones to understand the recommended end state.Next, explore each of the design areas. Use the areas to understand the considerations and decisions that you need to design and implement the landing zone that best fits your requirements.|[What is an Azure landing zone?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)[Azure landing zone design areas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|Align      |For organizations that have an existing environment that needs modification to align to the target architecture and best practices for an Azure landing zone (called brownfield).Use the transition from brownfield guidance to understand the decision points and technical approach to refactoring environments to align with the guidance in the Ready methodology.                                                                                                                                      |[Refactor a landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/refactor)[Transition existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/transition)[Scenarios: Transitioning existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/align-scenarios)|
|Enhance    |For environments that are already in line with best practices but the organization wants to add more controls or features.Explore articles about enhancing the key ongoing processes for cloud environments, such as management, governance, and security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |[Enhance guidance for management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/landing-zone-operations)[Enhance guidance for governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/landing-zone-governance)[Enhance guidance for security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/landing-zone-security)                                                                                      |
